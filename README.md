In the visualization above, I examined median treatment hospital emergency room treatment time by US state. According to US News and World Report, the northeast region of the United States holds the best states for health care, including Massachusetts (2), Connecticut (3), New Jersey (4), and Rhode Island (5). On the other hand, the southeast region of the US includes some of the lowest ranking states such as Mississippi (50), Oklahoma (49), West Virginia (48), and Arkansas (47). Given this ranking discrepency, I wanted to assess if efficiency of treatment in the emergency room, measured by median ER visit time, aligns with the hospitals which are ranked as the best for treatment. As seen in the visualization, there is evidence to refute my initial hypothesis that treatment time would be negatively correlated with hospital ranking (the higher the quality of care, the lower the ER visit time). Most states in the southeast seem to hold lower median ER treatment times than states in the norhteast. This pattern is backed with summary statistics: in the southeast region, the mean of median treatment times across states is approximately 281.86 minutes, while the the mean of median treatment times across states in the northeast is approximately 312.78 minutes. While there are a number of factors that may influence this result, one explanation may be that the states with the highest quality of care take more time purposefully, looking to assess all options for emergency room treatment, rather than looking to optimize time efficiency. Finally, most of this data was collected from April 2023 to April 2024, so we must proceed with caution while extrapolating trends to past years as it may not be fully representative.
